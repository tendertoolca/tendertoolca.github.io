<img src="img/property-maintenance-management.jpg" alt="property maintenance mangement" class="pull-left image-border"> Maxpanda Property Maintenance Software pertains to the processes applied to maximize returns by effective administration of property - one of the major assets of most organizations. It also comprises the disciplines implemented on property rules and rental policies. A property manager's employment can either be directly under the supervision of a real estate property owner, or for a property management company, hired by an owner or legal entity to look after the real estate over a particular span of time. A property management company is tasked with the responsibility of managing the multiple aspects which come along with the ownership of real estate. One of the important roles property management companies play is that of acting as liaison between the landlord and tenant. Their duties include posing appropriate gross rent, accepting rent, responding to and addressing maintenance issues, advertising vacancies for landlords, and doing credit and background checks on tenants. In exchange for the service provided, property management companies charge landlords a percentage of the gross rent collected each month, in addition to lease commissions. In addition to managing income and expense related activity, property managers may also manage construction, development, repair and maintenance on a property. The direction of repair and maintenance is quite a large part of a property manager's function. Property managers should develop a relationship with the management company property owner and tenants that is based on a mutual trust and complete confidence in one another. One way to add trust is to provide digital records of all maintenance activities conducted to the portfolio using Maxpanda Property Maintenance Software. This alliance with tenants gives an advantage to the landlord and provides them the necessary buffer servicing their desire to profit and distance themselves from their tenant constituency.
<br /><br />
<img src="img/propety-maintenance.jpg" alt="propety maintenance" class="pull-left image-border">
Special attention is given to Landlord Tenant law and most commonly evictions, non-payment, harassment, reduction of pre-arranged services, and public nuisance are legal subjects that gain the most amount of attention from property managers. Therefore, it is a necessity that a property manager be current with new laws and practices in their given localities, cities, provinces and states. Excellent property management Maxpanda Property Maintenance Software can only be achieved by top-notch managers who utilize the latest property management tools such as Maxpanda Property Maintenance Software. To be the best in this field, one must know and stay updated on local ordinances and state laws; be highly honest and ethical in enforcing property rules and rental policies; be detail oriented and organized with paper works; have good communication and computer skills; like working with the public; have a strong sense of duty and commitment; and be an exceptional follow-up person. You and your staff can decide how they want to track and control assets using multiple independent dimensions in real-time for equipment or space work orders. It leaves financial staff scrambling for information from many disparate sources, which in some cases is simply not there. 
<br /><br />
<img src="img/work-order-software.jpg" alt="work order software" class="pull-left image-border">
Finance and operations staff have different problems but the cause is the same. Free asset information is soloed in transactional systems, locked in spreadsheets, or in difficult to access paper files or simply has not been recorded anywhere. The asset management software such as Maxpanda Property Maintenance Software market has changed, forever. <strong>Property Maintenance Management Software</strong> is typically tailored to the needs of landlords and other rental property managers and companies, rather than for real estate developers. The needs of the latter are quite different from what is required to manage a portfolio of rented properties. And then there are the calls by pressured boards for large increases in performance figures, and equally large decreases in running costs. That leaves operations staff grappling with very few records making inaccurate decisions. So what are the typical needs of property managers? We look at these, and how <strong>property management software</strong> helps. Property Maintenance Management Software typically, a portfolio manager will be managing many properties, located at many places. The properties will consist of residential or commercial buildings each of which might have several units. Each unit might be rented out to different tenants. The rents from each tenant could differ not only in amounts but also on their due dates. Keeping track of rent dues and payments month after month (or week after week) thus becomes a little complicated. One solution is to generate a list of rent dues, showing amounts and due dates, every month or week. As each tenant pays the rent, the paid column in the list of dues can be updated. It then becomes easy to look at the blank paid columns and see which tenants are overdue with their rents. Late fees can be computed and billed by the software at periodic intervals. Over dues can be highlighted further by color-coding. For example, bright red color might indicate over dues exceeding three months, light reds can indicate over dues for shorter periods. In this way, you can easily track rent over dues and take different kinds of actions depending on the age of the over dues. In addition to accounting for rental, property managers also have to account for late fee dues and payments, payments for building, unit and appliances repair & maintenance, mortgage payments and any other transactions. The accounting module of the <strong>property management software</strong> will have facilities for recording all the different kinds of property related receipts and payments.

<b>Work Order Count</b> - Graph work order statuses by selecting start and end dates.  
<br />
<b>Work Order Summary</b> - A dynamic report allowing admins to select wo's by dates to create a real time report which includes: WO #, Title, Status, Start, Due, Completed, Closed, Type, Category, Hours, Labor, Parts, Invoice and Total Costs. This report can be extracted/downloaded to multiple file types including: <b>PDF, XLS, XLSX, RTF, MHT, HTML, TEXT, CSV and IMAGE</b>.
<br />
<b>Asset Cost Summary</b> - Similar to work order summary but admins select the desired assets within their account. This report can be extracted/downloaded to multiple file types including: <b>PDF, XLS, XLSX, RTF, MHT, HTML, TEXT, CSV and IMAGE</b>.
<br />
<b>Location Cost Summary</b> - Similar to asset cost summary - admins select buildings and or multiple locations to capture total costs. This report can be extracted/downloaded to multiple file types including: <b>PDF, XLS, XLSX, RTF, MHT, HTML, TEXT, CSV and IMAGE</b>.
<br />
<b>Resource Cost Summary</b> - Generate a report to calculate labor costs for one or a thousand resources, vendors, maintenance staff, contractors. This report can be extracted/downloaded to multiple file types including: <b>PDF, XLS, XLSX, RTF, MHT, HTML, TEXT, CSV and IMAGE</b>.
<br />
<b>Asset or Location Work Order Threshold</b> -  Generate reports for your Asset & Location types by setting a threshold on the amount of WO’s conducted per asset/location types. Why is this handy? Admins can determine why 10 work orders are happening at the same location type or to the same asset type each week. Admins set a Threshold # (1-whatever) and Period in Days (30-60-90 days). Running this report will provide data on asset or location types that have generated more work orders than the predefined threshold set by the Admin(s).

"I was looking for a CMMS to replace a simple database that was created in Access to handle work requests from building occupants. Unfortunately, the existing database has no provision for work order scheduling, costing, or true asset management. Most cmms software are expensive to deploy and very complicated to set up. These are two of the more attractive features of Maxpanda. The software is ready to use right out of the box, well the internet in this case. My team don't have decades of computer skills under their belts so using Maxpanda helps me get my work done quicker and easier. Reports are great, UI is simple to use, email and push mobile notifications are extremely valuable to me and my team. Great job!" - <b>Peter Krast, Project Manager @ HiArch Property Systems</b>
