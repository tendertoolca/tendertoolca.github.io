<p>Please review the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Socialist Rules</span> (which are part of these Terms) to better understand what is prohibited on the Service. We reserve the right at all times (but will not have an obligation) to remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, to suspend or terminate users, and to reclaim usernames without liability to you. We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to user support requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Socialist, its users and the public.</p>
<p>Except as permitted through the Services, these Terms, or the terms provided on <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dev.sociali.st</span>, you have to use the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Listless API </span>if you want to reproduce, modify, create derivative works, distribute, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, or otherwise use the Content or Services.</p>
<p>You may not do any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, Socialist’s computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Socialist’s providers; (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent any security or authentication measures; (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available, published interfaces that are provided by Socialist (and only pursuant to those terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Socialist (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in accordance with the provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services without the prior consent of Socialist is expressly prohibited); (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive or false source-identifying information; or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt to do so), the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.</p>
<h3>9. Copyright Policy</h3>
<p>Socialist respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of the Services to do the same. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us. If you believe that your Content has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information: (i) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to remove Content alleged to be infringing without prior notice, at our sole discretion, and without liability to you. In appropriate circumstances, Socialist will also terminate a user’s account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.

<h3>10. Ending These Terms</h3>
<p>The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Socialist as follows.</p>
<p>You may end your legal agreement with Socialist at any time for any reason by <span style="text-decoration: underline;">deactivating</span> your accounts and discontinuing your use of the Services. You do not need to specifically inform Socialist when you stop using the Services. If you stop using the Services without deactivating your accounts, your accounts may be deactivated due to prolonged inactivity under our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inactive Account Policy</span>.</p>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your accounts or cease providing you with all or part of the Services at any time for any reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably believe: (i) you have violated these Terms or the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Socialist Rules</span>, (ii) you create risk or possible legal exposure for us; or (iii) our provision of the Services to you is no longer commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your account or the next time you attempt to access your account.</p>
<p>In all such cases, the Terms shall terminate, including, without limitation, your license to use the Services, except that the following sections shall continue to apply: 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, and 12.</p>
<p>Nothing in this section shall affect Socialist’s rights to change, limit or stop the provision of the Services without prior notice, as provided above in section 1.</p>
<h3>11.Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</h3>
<p>Please read this section carefully since it limits the liability of Socialist and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (collectively, the “Socialist Entities”). Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>
<h3>A. The Services are Available &#8220;AS-IS&#8221;</h3>
<p>Your access to and use of the Services or any Content are at your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are provided to you on an &#8220;AS IS&#8221; and &#8220;AS AVAILABLE&#8221; basis. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, THE Socialist ENTITIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
<p>The Socialist Entities make no warranty and disclaim all responsibility and liability for: (i) the completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness, security or reliability of the Services or any Content; (ii) any harm to your computer system, loss of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or any Content; (iii) the deletion of, or the failure to store or to transmit, any Content and other communications maintained by the Services; and (iv) whether the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free basis. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from the Socialist Entities or through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein.</p>
<h3>B. Links</h3>
<p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that the Socialist Entities are not responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such websites or resources; or (ii) the content, products, or services on or available from such websites or resources. Links to such websites or resources do not imply any endorsement by the Socialist Entities of such websites or resources or the content, products, or services available from such websites or resources. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any such websites or resources.</p>
<h3>C. Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE Socialist ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (i) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (ii) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; (iii) ANY CONTENT OBTAINED FROM THE SERVICES; OR (iv) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.</p>
<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE Socialist ENTITIES EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00) OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID Socialist, IF ANY, IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.</p>
<p>THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SUBSECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE Socialist ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGE, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>
<h3>12. General Terms</h3>
<h3>A. Waiver and Severability</h3>
<p>The failure of Socialist to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h3>B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the New York State without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence. All claims, legal proceedings or litigation arising in connection with the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in Manhattan, New York, United States, and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
<p>If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the New York State (excluding choice of law).</p>
<h3>C. Entire Agreement</h3>
<p>These Terms, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Socialist Rules</span> and our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy Policy</span> are the entire and exclusive agreement between Socialist and you regarding the Services (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Socialist that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms), and these Terms supersede and replace any prior agreements between Socialist and you regarding the Services. Other than members of the group of companies of which Socialist, Inc. is the parent, no other person or company will be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.</p>
<p>We may revise these Terms from time to time, the most current version will always be at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Socialist.com/tos</span>. If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via e-mail to the email associated with your account or in-app notification. By continuing to access or use the Services after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
<p>These Services are operated and provided by The Bake Shop, LLC, 319 Lafayette St. #199 New York, NY 10012. If you have any questions about these Terms, please <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contact us</span>.</p>
